# Challenge #2 - Build a Tribute Pagem

<p> This is Challenge #2 out of 5 from the Responsive Web Design course at freeCodeCamp.</p>

## Challenge instructions:

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to https://tribute-page.freecodecamp.rocks.

<p>- Your tribute page should have a main element with a corresponding id of main, which contains all other elements</p>
<p>- You should see an element with an id of title, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")</p>
<p>- You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of img-div</p>
<p>- Within the #img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"</p>
<p>- Within the #img-div element, you should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in #img-div</p>
<p>- You should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page</p>
<p>- You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page.</p>
<p>- Your #image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size</p>
<p>- Your img element should be centered within its parent element</p>
